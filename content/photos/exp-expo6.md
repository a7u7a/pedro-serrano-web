**Surface Reading**\
The images were taken by NASA's Landsat mission. They represent the earth's topography by correlating altitude values to grayscale tones. For the exhibition I instead used circles to represent height. The highest point in an image was assigned the biggest diameter, and the lowest point got the smallest diameter.
